# Spot C++ SDK Release Notes

## Spot C++ SDK version 5.0.0 BETA

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

#### API

Please see the [General Release Notes](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/release_notes) for a description of the API changes included in release 5.0.0.

#### SDK

**Clients**

- Added [NetworkComputeBridgeClient](../cpp/bosdyn/client/network_compute_bridge/network_compute_bridge_client.cpp) client to support preexisting proto definitions.

- Added `SetGripperCameraCalib`, `SetGripperCameraCalibAsync`, `GetGripperCameraCalib`, and `GetGripperCameraCalibAsync` methods to [GripperCameraParamClient](../cpp/bosdyn/client/gripper_camera_param/gripper_camera_param_client.cpp).

**Helper Functions**

- Added a helper function, `NSecToDuration`, to [time.cpp](../cpp/bosdyn/common/time.cpp) that simplifies the creation of `::google::protobuf::Duration` objects from nanosecond inputs.

- Added two helper functions, `EigenToApiProto` and `CreateVec2`, [proto_math.cpp](../cpp/bosdyn/math/proto_math.cpp) to streamline the creation of API-compatible math messages.

  - `EigenToApiProto` converts the input `Eigen::Quaternion` object to a `::bosdyn::api::Quaternion` object.
  - `CreateVec2` returns a `::bosdyn::api::Vec2` object based upon the input `x` and `y`.

- Added two file helper functions, `ParseMessageFromFileWithError` and `WriteMessageToFileWithError`, in [proto_file.cpp](../cpp/bosdyn/common/proto_file.cpp) that return an error code to provide specific details about read/write failures, supplementing the existing boolean success indicators. Use the new functions for more granular error handling.

**Miscellaneous**

- The preprocessor directive responsible for verifying the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) version now handles environments where `__GNUC__` is undefined.

### Spot Sample Code

#### Updated

- The joint control example now includes a [CMakeLists.txt](../cpp/examples/joint_control/CMakeLists.txt) file, enabling its compilation using the CMake build system for improved ease and correctness.

### Deprecations

Please see the [General Release Notes](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/release_notes) for a description of the API deprecations included in release 5.0.0.

## Spot C++ SDK version 4.1.1 BETA

### Compatibility

The recommended Ubuntu version is now Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (formerly 18.04 LTS). Please see the [quickstart](cpp/quickstart.md#system-requirements) for more information.

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

#### API

Please see the [General Release Notes](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/release_notes) for a description of the API changes included in release 4.1.1.

### Deprecations

Please see the [General Release Notes](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/release_notes) for a description of the API deprecations included in release 4.1.1.

## Spot C++ SDK version 4.1.0 BETA

### New Features

#### Graph Nav

- Added support for uploading and downloading [graphs](../protos/bosdyn/api/graph_nav/map.proto#graph) larger than 4 MB has been added via the [UploadGraphStreaming](../protos/bosdyn/api/graph_nav/graph_nav_service.proto#uploadgraphstreaming) and [DownloadGraphStreaming](../protos/bosdyn/api/graph_nav/graph_nav_service.proto#downloadgraphstreaming) RPCs, respectively. Please see the corresponding client implementation in [GraphNavClient](../cpp/bosdyn/client/graph_nav/graph_nav_client.cpp).

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

#### API

Please see the [General Release Notes](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/release_notes) for a description of the API changes included in release 4.1.0.

#### SDK

Math & Frame Helpers

- A new reference frame, "feet_center", has been added. Please see the [General Release Notes](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/release_notes) for more information.

- The supplied `z_height` argument in the `SafeInflate` method is now actually used. Previously, the `z_height` argument was not passed to the inner method, `Inflate`, and hence defaulted to `0.0`, regardless of its value, thereby leading to an incorrect z-coordinate in the returned `SE3Pose`.

### Deprecations

Please see the [General Release Notes](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/release_notes) for a description of the API deprecations included in release 4.1.0.

### Spot Sample Code

#### Updated

- Updated the [basic_robot_command.cpp](../cpp/examples/basic_robot_command/basic_robot_command.cpp) example to use the [RobotCommandFeedback](../protos/bosdyn/api/robot_command_service.proto#robotcommandfeedback) RPC instead of sleeping for an arbitrary amount of time.

- The choreography proto libraries have been deprecated and removed. The protos included in `libbosdyn_choreography_protos.so` and `libbosdyn_choreography_protos_static.a` will now be included in `libbosdyn_api.so` and `libbosdyn_api_static.a`.

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

#### API

Please see the [General Release Notes](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/release_notes) for a description of the API changes included in release 4.0.0.

#### SDK

The C++ standard in the CMake file has been changed from cxx_std_14 to cxx_std_17.

Clients are now configured with a default 5s keep-alive time, which triggers a faster reconnect with the service, when the network connection goes down.

Lease update change: ignore failed old leases in the case the wallet contains the new lease.

Data Acquisition Client

- Added `GetLiveData` method to allow payloads to publish live data to the robot that is displayed on the tablet and Orbit during teleoperation

Data Acquisition Store Client

- Added `QueryStoredCaptures` method to enable retrieval of data from the robot using gRPC instead of the `/v1/data-buffer/daq-data/` endpoint
- Added `QueryMaxCaptureId` method, which returns the the `max_capture_id` corresponding to the greatest capture ID on the robot; this can be used to exclude preexisting data on the robot from retrieval by setting the `captures_from_id` field in the `QueryParameters` message accordingly.

Mission Client

- Added `GetInfoAsChunks` method, which enables the retrieval of static information describing the mission for missions whose size exceeds the maximum message size.

Power Client

- Added `ResetSafetyStop` method, which enables the primary and redundant safety stops on a Safety-Related Stopping Function (SRSF) configured robot. Robots equipped with this feature will be listed as SRSF "Enabled" under the hardware information section found in the "About" page on the robot's admin console.
- Added a set of helper functions in `power_client_helper.h` to be used with a power client.

SpotCam Compositor Client

- Now sets both the `coords` (deprecated in v3.3) and `meter` fields for backwards compatibility purposes in the corresponding methods.

Math & Frame Helpers

- The `ExternalStringToInternalString` and `InternalStringToExternalString` methods now return `std::nullopt` if the frame name does not exist.
- The kinematic_state's transforms_snapshot now uses "arm0.link_wr1" instead of "link_wr1" for the name of the frame attached to the SpotArm's wr1 link. This is (1) the name used in the URDF description of the robot and (2) the name used in the image service snapshots. We will continue to publish the kinematic_state's snapshot with the deprecated name in the 4.0 release, but it will be removed in a future release.
- An enum class called `RobotSpecies` has been added.
- Two frame names have been added, namely `ecef` (Earth-centered, Earth-fixed) and `enu` (East-North-Up), that are used for localization with respect to the Earth.
- Renamed `find_tree_root` method as `FindTreeRoot`
- Added a helper function `ReparentFrame`

Autowalk Player

- Sets `navigation_id` instead of `root_id` in the `SetNodeMap` method; the latter is deprecated as of v4.0

## Spot C++ SDK version 3.2.0 BETA

### New Features

#### Autowalk Service

Enables API clients to specify high level autonomous behaviors for Spot using an easily editable format. The autowalk format is a list of actions and their associated locations. Using this service, users can program the robot to “go to location A, perform action A, go to location B, perform action B, etc.”. The autowalk service compiles the autowalk into a behavior tree that can then be uploaded to the robot and played using the mission service. Previously this feature was only available on the tablet, but now it is a service for all client applications.

#### Graph Nav – Area Callbacks

Enables users to register a callback that is called in certain areas of the map during navigation. These “Area Callbacks” can instruct the robot to wait until the area is safe to cross (such as a crosswalk), take control of the robot and perform an action (such as opening a door), or perform a background action while in a certain area of the map (such as flashing lights or playing sounds).
This enables integration with the [Graph Nav](concepts/autonomy/graphnav_service.md) navigation system to extend its capabilities in terms of safety and new actions while navigating. See the [Area Callback](concepts/autonomy/graphnav_area_callbacks.md) documentation for more details.

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

#### API

Please see the [General Release Notes](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/release_notes) for a description of the API changes included in release 3.2.0.

#### SDK

Added `RetryableUnavailableError` RPCErrorCode and `RetryableRPCCondition` to check whether a failed RPC should be retried.

Fixed issues in the `ConvertGRPCStatus` method that converts grpc:Status to our `::bosdyn::common::Status`.

Added `LoadMissionAsChunks` and `LoadMissionAsChunksAsync` methods in `MissionClient`.

Added `FanPowerCommandAsync` and `FanPowerCommand` methods in `PowerClient`.

Added `UpdateSecureChannelPort` in Robot class to update the port used for creating secure channels, instead of using the default 443

Fixed ordering of adding RPC calls to the gRPC completion queue in ServiceClient class to fix a memory leak caused if RPCs are completed right away.

Added `InitiateRequestStreamAsyncCallWithChunking` and `InitiateRequestResponseStreamAsyncCallWithChunking` helper functions in `ServiceClient` class to be used when directly streaming DataChunks.

Added `SetupRequestStreamCall` and `SetupRequestResponseStreamCall` helper functions in `ServiceClient` class that initiates a request stream async call.

Added `Is` helper function in `Status` class to check if this `Status` matches a certain error enum.

### Breaking Changes

Updated `StringToDataChunks`and `MessageToDataChunks` method signatures in data_chunking to accept a vector of `::bosdyn::api::DataChunk` instead of a vector of `std::unique_ptr<::bosdyn::api::DataChunk>`.

### Dependencies

### Known Issues

### Sample Code

[Query Autowalk Status](../cpp/examples/query_autowalk_status/README.md): Example that loads an Autowalk and GraphNav map to the robot from a file. It then queries the status of elements and actions in the walk as the Autowalk mission plays.
