/**
 * A custom signed format.  Sequentially laid out:
 *
 *   4 bytes header
 *   20 bytes fingerprint
 *   512 bytes signature
 *   X bytes data.
 *
 * header -> When this format changes, we'll use the header to deliminate which
 * format was used to generate this data.
 *
 * fingerprint -> The fingerprint of public key corresponding to the private key
 * that was used to generate the signature.  As keys rotate, this will allow
 * the signature verifier to know what key to use to verify the signature.
 *
 * signature -> signature of the data field.
 *
 * data -> Contents specified by parent container.  Usually contains a serialized
 * protobuf.
