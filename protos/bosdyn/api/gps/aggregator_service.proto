 * The AggregatorService is an endpoint that clients should send GPS data too.

 *     - A GPS will be connected to a peripheral computer
 *     - The peripheral computer should establish timesync with the robot
 *     - The peripheral computer should read data from the GPS hardware
 *     - The peripheral computer should send timestamped data to the AggregatorService
