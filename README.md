# Spot C++ SDK (BETA)

Develop applications and payloads for Spot using the Boston Dynamics Spot C++ SDK. The Spot C++ SDK is a **beta** release.

The C++ SDK consists of:

- [C++ client library](docs/cpp/README.md). Applications using the C++ library can control Spot and read sensor and health information from Spot. A variety of example programs and a QuickStart guide are also included.
- [Spot C++ SDK Repository](https://github.com/boston-dynamics/spot-cpp-sdk). The GitHub repo where all of the Spot C++ SDK code is hosted.

The official Spot SDK documentation also contains information relevant to the C++ SDK:

- [Conceptual documentation](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/readme). These documents explain the key abstractions used by the Spot API.
- [Payload developer documentation](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/payload/readme). Payloads add additional sensing, communication, and control capabilities beyond what the base platform provides. The Payload ICD covers the mechanical, electrical, and software interfaces that Spot supports.
- [Spot API protocol definition](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/protos/readme). This reference guide covers the details of the protocol applications used to communicate to Spot. Application developers who wish to use a language other than Python can implement clients that speak the protocol.

This is version 5.0.0 of the C++ SDK. Please review the [Release Notes](docs/cpp_release_notes.md) to see what has changed.
